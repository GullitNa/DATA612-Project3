        "The recommender system that I'll be using for this project is the item-item collaborative filtering from my last project assignment (based on jokedataset3 from https://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/). The item-item collaborative filtering does capture shared user ratings, but its accuracy depends heavily on having a sufficient number of user ratings which in this dataset I would argue is sufficient enough for this project. Following which I aim to implement truncated singular value decomposition (SVD)."

He decides that he wants to read all of the ancient original text of the Holy Scriptures, so he spends the next eon or so learning languages. After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent \"Easy Reading\" to the original script. All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The Angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, \"An 'R'! The scribes left out the 'R'.\"  A particularly concerned Angel takes him aside, offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what does he mean.  After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, \"It's the letter 'R'. They left out the 'R'. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!\"\n",

            "There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all  things mechanical.  After serving his company loyally for over 30  years, he happily retired.  Several years later the company contacted  him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with  one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and  everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail.  In  desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so  many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying  the huge machine.  At the end of the day, he marked a small \"x\" in  chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,  \"This is where your problem is\". The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The  company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his  service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The  engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark                       $1  Knowing where to put it            $49,999 It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.\n",

St. Peter checks his dossier and says, \"Ah, you're an engineer--you're in the wrong place.\" So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, \"So, how's it going down there in hell?\" Satan replies, \"Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.\" God replies, \"What?? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.\" Satan says, \"No way.\" I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him.\" God says, \"Send him back up here or I'll sue.\" Satan laughs uproariously and answers, \"Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?\"\n"

        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "Extended my existing item–item collaborative filtering recommender (from JokeDataset3) by implementing truncated SVD as a matrix‐factorization method a recommendation context. After loading and cleaning the Jester jokes ratings matrix, I imputed missing values with each user’s mean, mean‐centered the data, and applied TruncatedSVD to extract the top k (latent) factors (which was k = 20). Afterwhich, reconstructed the ratings and added back the user means to produce a dense prediction matrix, which I evaluated on a held-out test set using RMSE. The Medium tutorial “Recommender System — singular value decomposition (SVD) & truncated SVD” was a guideline used in both clarifying and udnerstanding the difference between full and truncated SVD, showing code examples for performing the decomposition and reconstructing predictions, and guiding my choice of how to integrate truncated SVD rather than full SVD into my recommender system.\n",
